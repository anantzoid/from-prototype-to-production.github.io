        <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
        <p>
            Deploying machine learning models in production has challenges across multiple dimensions. Challenges spanning across scale (computation power, infrastructure support), software development, continuous integration-continues deployment CI/CD, and eventually the consumption of the model for desired use cases and their cascading effects. Over the past few years, this process has been captured under the specific umbrella of ML Ops and more recently LLM Ops. ML Ops is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous delivery practice of DevOps in the software field. The ecosystem of ML Ops is further convoluted for any industry with strict regulatory requirements and even more complex for the financial sector. Any significant event or sudden changes in the market can throw these ML models askew. While implementing these models in production they have to be robust against sudden changes in the market at the same time checks need to be put in place to identify any anomalies, outliers, drift, and bad data.

        <p>
            This workshop aims to tackle the emerging challenges rapidly developing in running AI models in production specifically for the financial sector. The workshop aims to focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficient model prototyping, calibration, inferencing, and serving</li>
            <li>Privacy and security for AI and ML models</li>
            <li>Explainability, interpretability, and robustness of AI models in production</li>
            <li>Testing, debugging, and monitoring models</li>
            <li>Infrastructure and hardware efficient ML models</li>
            <li>Efficient implementation and best practices ML Ops and LLM Ops</li>
            <li>Data Quality check, model surveillance, model diagnostics, and model re-calibration</li>
            <li>AI observability, AI model evaluation metrics</li>
        </ul>
